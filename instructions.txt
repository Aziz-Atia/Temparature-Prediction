As the climate changes, predicting the weather becomes ever more important for businesses. You have been asked to support on a machine learning project with the aim of building a pipeline to predict the climate in London, England. Specifically, the model should predict mean temperature in degrees Celsius (째C).

Since the weather depends on a lot of different factors, you will want to run a lot of experiments to determine what the best approach is to predict the weather. In this project, you will run experiments for different regression models predicting the mean temperature, using a combination of `sklearn` and `mlflow`.

You will be working with data stored in `london_weather.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **date** - recorded date of measurement - (**int**)
- **cloud_cover** - cloud cover measurement in oktas - (**float**)
- **sunshine** - sunshine measurement in hours (hrs) - (**float**)
- **global_radiation** - irradiance measurement in Watt per square meter (W/m2) - (**float**)
- **max_temp** - maximum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (째C) - (**float**)
- **mean_temp** - **target** mean temperature in degrees Celsius (째C) - (**float**)
- **min_temp** - minimum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (째C) - (**float**)
- **precipitation** - precipitation measurement in millimeters (mm) - (**float**)
- **pressure** - pressure measurement in Pascals (Pa) - (**float**)
- **snow_depth** - snow depth measurement in centimeters (cm) - (**float**)

Use machine learning to predict the mean temperature in London, England, logging your root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics using mlflow.

-Build a model to predict "mean_temp" with a RMSE of 3 or less.
-Use MLflow to log any models you train, their hyperparameters, and respective RMSE scores (ensuring you include "rmse" as part of the metric name).
-Search all of your mlflow runs and store the results as a variable called experiment_results.
